# What is it?

This is a Windows application specifically Widgets that are added to the Widget popup on Windows 11.

# What does it do?

The application has 2 widgets in it. One is for showing PC performance and another to take notes. 

# Use Case :
  ### PC Perfomance:
  When running rendering applications like AfterEffects or PremierePro using MSI Afterburner causes multiple On-Screen Displays instead of one. Even if I turn off On-Screen display, The constant monitoring on the background is not much use to me. So,            Instead of running MSI Afterburner. I have added a widget to show my CPU, GPU and RAM usage on the widget bar. 

  ### Notes:
  Using Windows Notes app, Adds an icon to my taskbar cluttering it. Also, requiring it to launch it everytime. Microsoft Notes Widget requires me to logon with an Microsoft account to take notes. So, This widget was created to allow me to take notes and        store locally on my PC.
